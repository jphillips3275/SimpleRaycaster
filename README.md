Started as a getting used to C# project which is why there's some code that doesn't really do much of anything and once I had the rendering, movement, and map layout setup turned into a raycaster project.

Things to improve:
  the math for the "3d" rendering is still messed up despite my efforts causing a slight fisheye lense effect
  I suspect I have a severe memory leak problem which is why it seems arbitrary if the code decides to run or not.
